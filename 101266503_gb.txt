George Brown College was formed in 1967 to serve the central core of the present City of Toronto

WHY CHOOSE GEORGE BROWN COLLEGE?
Toronto is home to many major industries in Canada and is one of the most important economic hubs in North America. As such, the city becomes a living lab for our students. We have three campuses and several locations that place students in the heart of downtown Toronto â€” St. James Campus, Casa Loma Campus and Waterfront Campus.
